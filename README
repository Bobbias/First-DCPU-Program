This project is being developed in Team Chicken's DevKit environment. The actual code is stored in Test1/

This project's future goal is to be a platform which precompiled game binaries can be included into, and run from.

It is currently in it's very early stages, as it is a one man project. Any help would be appreciated, and feel free to use the code here however you want. I tend to comment things a lot since it's harder to tell at a glance what something does in assembly.

Feel free to drop me a line by email (Bobbias@gmail.com) msn (Bobbias@hotmail.com) on IRC (irc.freenode.net/#0x10c-dev) or via skype (Bobbiasv2).
